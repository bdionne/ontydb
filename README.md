ontydb
======

Ontydb is a functional-relational database. By functional we mean in
the strict mathematical sense of a function as a specific form of
relation, rather than functional as in functional programming. The 
distinction between relations and functions nicely
captures ideas about objects and their properties (functions)
versus objects in relation to other objects (relations).

This work will be somewhat similar to [bitstore][1], particularly in the use of [bitcask][2], to provide a simple key value store as the underlying storage layer.
